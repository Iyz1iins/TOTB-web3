            <h1> Summary:</h1>
            <p>We are a group of 3  members we had a very long journey with many struggles to face, The roles were 3 (programmer (Ali),  Info gathering (Ebrahim), designer (Yosef).
                Many tasks were assigned and different problems were faced but we did it at the end, our contributions were a lot some did interviews with customers to get the best answer for making our website much user friendly, also programming the website from scratch since we are IT students we thought that it would be much better to code the entire website to know how to fix everything rather than using some Ai tool, and at the end the designing part which ensured that all the colors and text sizes are more easy to look and not too bright for the customers eyes comfort.</p>

        <h1>Challenges:</h1>
       <p>We encountered various challenges during the project, but we were able to overcome them. 
        The first obstacle was scheduling meetings, as it was sometimes hard to get all group members together, and the time we had for meetings felt insufficient.  
        We also faced challenges in choosing the most pleasant colors and pictures for each page, which took us time to check several options until we were satisfied. 
        Another challenge was designing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that balanced aesthetics with functionality. Feedback from team members and user testing played a crucial role in refining the website's design. We also had an issue with how we could work on the same HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files simultaneously. 
        At first, we were unsure which approach to take, but we discovered that since we all use Visual Studio, we could use an extension called Live Share, which allowed us to access and make modifications live.

            <h1> Learning about Group Project Work:</h1>
            <p>We learned that group work makes things easier by dividing the work individually and then meeting up and checking on each other's work. 
                We also learned that group members always want the best for each other, so they will be honest and tell you what needs to be done and fixed. 
                By working together as a team, we learned that we all have different opinions and perspectives that may cause conflict, but we can always reach a solution by discussing and hearing each other out. 
                We also learned that each person has different skills, and we rely on each other as a group. 
                Each team member brought unique skills and perspectives, enabling efficient task allocation and leveraging expertise. 
                Acknowledging and valuing diverse skill sets fostered inclusivity and encouraged active participation from all team members.

            <h1>Technical Learnings:</h1>
            <p>We learned a lot and enjoyed creating something from our own ideas and implementing them in code. 
                We gained a significant amount of technical skills in web development, especially related to CSS. 
                Our debugging skills have improved, as we now know how to structure and layout the page. 
                When we encounter an issue, we can debug, identify the problem, and fix it. We also had the chance to learn layout techniques and transitions. 
                Additionally, we learned the importance of designing before implementing. It is essential to know what you aim to accomplish and have a direct path of what you are expected to implement. We also learned to think like web developers, seeing things in a structured manner. We realized that user experience is crucial. It is important for a user to be able to function easily throughout the website, and user experience and satisfaction are essential for any website's success. 
                We were able to learn how to design mockups, play around with hover effects, and create visually appealing layouts, responsive designs, and interactive features.</p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, the Voyage website project offered valuable learning experiences. 
                Overcoming challenges related to information accuracy, design, and user experience allowed the team to develop effective problem-solving and collaboration skills. 
                The project also enhanced technical proficiency in web development, multimedia integration, and search engine optimization. Through this group project, insights were gained into teamwork dynamics, effective communication, and the significance of leveraging individual strengths to achieve shared objectives. 
                By delivering an immersive virtual travel experience, the Voyage website aimed to inspire and educate users about the cultural heritage and unique attractions of Egypt, Italy, and Japan.
